            <p>I&apos;m a Software Developer focusing on backend development, where Iâ€™m learning to build solid, scalable systems and create integrations that support applications from the ground up. My main interest is in backend, but I&apos;m also able to work on the frontend when needed, allowing me to contribute to different parts of a project.</p>
